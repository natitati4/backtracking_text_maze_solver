# backtracking_text_maze_solver
Text based maze solver using backtracking.
The program gets a path to a file containing a maze written in text, and then creates a file next to it, with the solved maze.

For now, the limitations are:
1. The maze must have one entry and one exit.
2. Walls are marked by 0, free paths are marked by 1, and the entry is marked by 2.
3. The maze must not contain any loops.
4. The maze path must be hardcoded (in MainProgram.cs)
